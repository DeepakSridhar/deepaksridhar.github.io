I am a third year PhD student at UCSD specializing in Computer Vision, advised by Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos. My research focuses on multimodal generative AI, with interests spanning multimodal generation, editing, and understanding. I am also interested in efficient personalization methods.

My recent work is an efficient diffusion model framework ([link](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/factorgraphdiffusion.github.io/)) that offers high prompt compliance, controllability, modularity, editing and applicability to multimodal content generation (video, audio and 3D), understanding and editing. Previously, I have worked on some fundamental vision problems such as efficient classification and detection in images and videos.

Outside of Research, I love to go on hiking and exploring the nature. I also love to participate in outdoor adventures.
