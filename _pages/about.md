I am a first year PhD student at UCSD with a focus on Computer Vision. I am working under Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos on the intersection of generative modeling (diffusion models) and 3D vision problems (multi-modal fusion). I am also working on some fundamental vision problems such as efficient classification and detection in images and videos.

Outside of Research, I love to go on hiking and exploring the nature. I also love to participate in outdoor adventures.
