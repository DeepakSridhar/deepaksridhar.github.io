I am a fourth year PhD student at UC San Diego specializing in Computer Vision, advised by [Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos](http://www.svcl.ucsd.edu/people/nuno/). My research focuses on multimodal generative AI, with particular interests in multimodal generation, editing, and understanding, as well as efficient personalization methods.

During my PhD, I have developed an efficient diffusion model framework ([project page](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/factorgraphdiffusion.github.io/), NeurIPS’24), explored efficient prompting techniques ([project page](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/promptsliders.github.io/), ECCV’24) and worked on efficient video reasoning ([paper](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.17045)). My work addresses challenges such as improving prompt compliance, controllability, modularity, and editing in multimodal generation in an efficient manner. Prior to my PhD, I have also worked on fundamental problems in computer vision such as efficient image classification, object detection, action recognition and localization.
<!-- My recent work is an efficient diffusion model framework ([link](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/factorgraphdiffusion.github.io/)) that offers high prompt compliance, controllability, modularity, editing and applicability to multimodal content generation (video, audio and 3D), understanding and editing. Previously, I have worked on some fundamental vision problems such as efficient classification and detection in images and videos. -->

Outside of Research, I love to go on hiking and exploring the nature. I also love to participate in outdoor adventures.
