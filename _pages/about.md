I am a fourth year PhD student at UCSD specializing in Computer Vision, advised by Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos. My research focuses on multimodal generative AI, with interests spanning multimodal generation, editing, and understanding. I am also interested in efficient personalization methods.

During my PhD, I have worked on an efficient diffusion model framework ([project page](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/factorgraphdiffusion.github.io/), NeurIPS’24), efficient prompting techniques ([project page](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/promptsliders.github.io/), ECCV’24) and efficient video reasoning (under review) that address problems such as better prompt compliance, controllability, modularity, and editing for multi-modal 
generation. Prior to my PhD, I have also worked on fundamental problems such as efficient image classification, detection and action 
recognition.
<!-- My recent work is an efficient diffusion model framework ([link](https://deepaksridhar.github.io/factorgraphdiffusion.github.io/)) that offers high prompt compliance, controllability, modularity, editing and applicability to multimodal content generation (video, audio and 3D), understanding and editing. Previously, I have worked on some fundamental vision problems such as efficient classification and detection in images and videos. -->

Outside of Research, I love to go on hiking and exploring the nature. I also love to participate in outdoor adventures.
