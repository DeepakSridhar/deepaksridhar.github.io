I am a second year PhD student at UCSD with a focus on Computer Vision. I am working under Prof. Nuno Vasconcelos on generative modeling (diffusion models) for multimodal vision problems (images/video/3D content generation). Currently, I am working on a 2D/3D diffusion model framework that offers high fidelity, controllability, modularity, (re)-usability (adapting existing foundational models) and applicability (data augmentation) for various downstream vision tasks. I am also working on some fundamental vision problems such as efficient classification and detection in images and videos.

Outside of Research, I love to go on hiking and exploring the nature. I also love to participate in outdoor adventures.
